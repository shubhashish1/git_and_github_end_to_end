1. Git is a version control software and github is the host or container of the git.
2. So git is a software and github is the service used to host git online.
3. If our software is working good in one set up and condition, then we can set a checkpoint using git in the
   software to guide us back to the same checkpoint if anything is not working with modifications.
4. In git we have version control system which tracks our files and also it sets checkpoints in code for us.

Git and Github are different:

Git is a version control system that is used to track changes to your files. It is a free and open-source 
software that is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Remember, GIT is a software and can be installed on 
your computer.

Github is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. Github is an online platform that allows you to store
and share your code with others. It is a popular platform for developers to collaborate on projects and to share
code. It is not that Github is the only provider of Git repositories, but it is one of the most popular ones.

5. There are other version control softwares like git which are svn, cvs, perforce, mercury etc.

GIT TERMINOLOGIES:

1. To check the version of git we have the command git --version
2. In git the folders are called as repositories.
3. So the git folder or repositories start with a name .git
4. TO check the git folders present we can have the command git status
5. Git also saves our info in the tracking so that whenever we do something then it can track who did
   the changes and also it is easy to track in online i.e in github.
6. Let's set ourselfs up in git by using this command: git cofig --global user.email "your-email-id"
7. Here global is used to set up this for all repositories.  But we can also customize it by using our
   different config instead of global.
8. To check our existing configs we can use command: git config --list
9. We can have our username or any name set in git for tracking using command: git config --global user.name "name"
10. Now to create our first git repo we will use command git init. 
11. But before using git init we need to do git status to check whether we have any git repo before or not.
12. If we have then we don't need to create a new repo as there can be a chance that it can erase the previous 
    git repo mappings.
13. Now mostly the .git folder is hidden. TO check the hidden folder in cmd we can use git bash and command is:
    ls -la
14. We can go inside the .git floder and check the file and folders inside it.
15. Now git has basic highlevel structure as write -> add -> commit
16. In write we write our codes. 
17. Then we add our codes to push to the github service area where we can save our repo online.
18. The command is git add (filename) or (.) for all filenames
19. Once we do this all our changes or codes are staged or we can say then come to the stage in our play
    and ready to do the performance. Hence it is called staging area.
20. Now we do git commit with a message or checkpoint identifier by command
    git commit -m "commit message".
21. This will add checkpoint on the files or changes added in the git add.
22. We can call it as a group of ppl came on to stage for dancing but we have asked a set of ppl only to dance
    first. Let's say in DID we have 4 groups on the stage and we have asked the group 1 to dance.
    So group1 will have a performance and they can call it with a name say may be Shiv tandav. So the performance
    of group1 they are doing now is saved with a checkpoint Shiv tandav.
23. Now we use git push -u origin branch name and push that change or performance into our branch with the checkpoint given.
    Here we can call the branch as episode of the show. We sabe it into the github.
24. We can use git status basically after every command to check what happened due to the command and where are we now.
